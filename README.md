# greycom v1.0
### Greynoise CLI for Community API users
---
**ONLY TESTED ON 64BIT UBUNTU 20.04**

I'm not a go dev, mostly just pieced some code together to get a cli that would work for the community API (apparently, the API key doesn't even matter for these endpoints, so I changed it to a warning instead of an exit).

Only feature available for community is standard IP lookup, so don't expect anything fancy.

Haven't parsed output yet, just outputs the json.

**Install**
Again, not a go dev, I think this is how you're supposed to do it, who knows
```bash
go get github.com/jsownz/greycom
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/jsownz/greycom
go install
sudo ln -s $(go env GOPATH)/bin/greycom /usr/local/bin/greycom
```

**Usage**
```bash
greycom -t [target_ip]
```

To save your Community API key, use the -apikey flag:
```bash
greycom -t [target_ip] -apikey [community_api_key]
```
