### Greynoise CLI for Community API users
---
**ONLY TESTED ON 64BIT UBUNTU 20.04**

I'm not a go dev, mostly just pieced some code together to get a cli that would work for the community API (apparently, the API key doesn't even matter for these endpoints, so I changed it to a warning instead of an exit).

Only feature available for community is standard IP lookup, so don't expect anything fancy.

Haven't parsed output yet, just outputs the json.
